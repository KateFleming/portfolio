                </h2>
                <p> Hi I'm Kate. I'm a Seattle based web developer and designer, and an aspiring entrapreneur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been an artist all my life, working mostly with paint, I figured it was time to step it up and work with a new medium. My desire to develop, build, and create has landed me right in the middle of the world of website design and development, and I couldn't be happier.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not messing around creating or learning code, you'll find me doing flips in the gym, hiking up a mountain, or writing a new piano piece. Check out my blog for some awesome pics.
